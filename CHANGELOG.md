### Project Status
**✅ Complete:** Architecture, FreeRTOS integration, testing framework, documentation.

**🔄 In Progress:** N/A

**⏳ TODO (Priority Order):**
1. Pico SDK integration (Pico 2W hardware support)
2. I2C driver for MPU6050 (real sensor readout)
3. WiFi and lwIP integration (telemetry transmission)
4. Kalman filter for attitude estimation
5. Advanced control algorithms (LQR, MPC)
6. Flight-ready hardening (watchdog, safe states, logging)
